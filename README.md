# landing-on-rails
A small portfolio project to messaround with Ruby on Rails and display my enthusiasm for Software Engineering roles and distain of neverending hackerrank/leetcode problems :P

Creating a frame for my video cover letter to woo you (uwu) 
while learning some Ruby and those Rails they supposedly roll on ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ

Maybe I'll expand this into a real portfolio someday with other sections.... hence the name `portfolio`
