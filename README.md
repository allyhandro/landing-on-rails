# landing-on-rails
A small portfolio project to messaround with Ruby on Rails and display my enthusiasm for Software Engineering roles and distain of neverending hackerrank/leetcode problems :P

It's been a while since I've worked on strictly frontend, and with all the time on my funemployed hands since my layoff in April I figured I might as well learn a new language as well. It's a good refreher too as I plan on applying to some Fullstack roles. 

## The Vision
Creating a frame for my video cover letter to woo you (uwu) 
while learning some Ruby and those Rails they supposedly roll on ·ïï( ·êõ )·ïó

- [Project Notion](https://www.notion.so/anime-garbage/Project-Down-the-Barrel-6e750f09f58e49eea8ef8770e47cf3c5?pvs=4) {{UNPUBLISHED}}

Maybe I'll expand this into a real portfolio someday with other sections.... hence the name `portfolio`

Things you may want to cover:

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
&nbsp;Supposedly there's a Rakefile that's more or less == Makefile...
&nbsp;but until then
&nbsp;to start server
&nbsp;`rails s` 
(Ctrl-C to stop)

`rubocop`

* ...
