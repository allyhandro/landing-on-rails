# landing-on-rails
A small portfolio project to messaround with Ruby on Rails and display my enthusiasm for Software Engineering roles and distain of neverending hackerrank/leetcode problems :P

It's been a while since I've worked on strictly frontend, and with all the time on my funemployed hands since my layoff in April I figured I might as well learn a new language as well. It's a good refreher too as I plan on applying to some Fullstack roles. 

## The Vision
Creating a frame for my video cover letter to woo you (uwu) 
while learning some Ruby and those Rails they supposedly roll on ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ

- [Project Notion](https://www.notion.so/anime-garbage/Project-Down-the-Barrel-6e750f09f58e49eea8ef8770e47cf3c5?pvs=4) {{UNPUBLISHED}}

Maybe I'll expand this into a real portfolio someday with other sections.... hence the name `portfolio`

### Deployment instructions
This project was made with Ruby version `3.3.0`. Supposedly there's a Rakefile to be used that's more or less == Makefile...but until I understand that config, to start server use:
`rails s` 

### Linting
haha, I'm a robot too, RuboCop. 
`rubocop`

#### System dependencies / Notable Gems (for me, a newbie)
* Hotwire - default front-end for Rails: apparently rails devs avoid js like the plague ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
* [RuboCop](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop)🤖  



### Boilerplate rails
---
Things you may want to cover:

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* ...
